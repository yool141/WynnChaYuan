# WynnChaYuan

繁體中文：**[README.md](README.md)**

A multi-language translation mod for Wynncraft (Fabric 1.21.11). **The original text is kept**; the
translation is shown beside it, or written in its place.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a beta.** Some of the translations are written by hand and then rendered by AI,
> a smaller part is translated by AI directly, and most of the core content has been
> proofread by a person. The other languages are currently AI-translated from the
> Traditional Chinese, so expect mistranslations and inconsistent terms.
> Report problems to **LyuChaCha** on Discord or on
> [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LyuChaCha/WynnChaYuan/issues).

## Features

### What it translates

| Content | What is translated, and how it is shown |
|---|---|
| Item tooltips | Gear lore, stats, Major IDs; a panel beside the tooltip, or written into the tooltip itself |
| Ability trees | Nodes, descriptions and archetypes for all five classes |
| Quest dialogue, dialogue choices | Written into **Wynncraft's own dialogue box** (frame, nameplate and portrait kept), typed out in step with the original; or a separate box |
| Quest tracker | Its own box; the heading says what is tracked (quest, world event, cave, raid…) |
| NPC nameplates, floating text | A box while you look at one, or replaced in place; crafting stations and interaction prompts included |
| Chat messages | Server messages (quest completions, rewards, area transitions); column layouts such as the Lootrun summary and beacons stay aligned. Player chat is never translated |
| Menus and interfaces | Trade market, guild, store and other screens |
| Lootruns, raids, dungeons | Missions, boons, beacons, aspects, gambits, end-of-run and loot panels, dungeon names and keys |
| Discoveries, secret discoveries | Names, descriptions and stories |
| Title text | The big title and subtitle in the middle of the screen |

Gear names stay in English by default: they are proper nouns, and the trade market and the wiki use
the English ones. F6 can turn them on.

### More

- **Translations update themselves**: translations are downloaded from GitHub, so new ones arrive on your next launch, **no mod update needed**. Offline, the last cache or the copy in the jar is used
- **Market search**: search the trade market in your language; the English name is sent. Matches are listed as you type: ↑↓ to pick, Tab to fill
- **Copy chat**: lists recent chat messages; click one to copy it for a report (key unbound by default)
- **Panel screenshot**: **F9** copies the translation panel to the clipboard or saves it to a file (rebindable)
- **Adjustable panels**: boxes can be dragged; dialogue, choices and the tracker can be resized from the corner
- **Update notice**: says so once in chat when a new version is out, linking to GitHub Releases
- **Contributor tags**: people on the credits list get an extra line above their nameplate, visible only to others running the mod (can be turned off)

**Client-side only.** The server does not need it.

### Settings (F6)

| Tab | What's in it |
|---|---|
| Items | Item translation (separate panel / replace in place / off), translate item names, market search, panel screenshot |
| Panel | Follow the mouse or pin it, which side, gap, border colour, arrange the boxes |
| Dialogue | Quest dialogue, dialogue choices (separate box / replace in place / off), hold time, dialogue/tracker boxes |
| World & chat | Nameplates and floating text (with range and aim angle), chat messages, title text, copy chat |
| Data | Translation language, fallback language, interface language, translation source, reload, collect untranslated strings, collect GUI text, export untranslated strings, how to submit, debug dumps |

Hover a setting for an explanation.

## Languages and progress

| Language | Coverage |
|---|---|
| `zh_tw` Traditional Chinese | Main language, everything |
| `zh_cn` Simplified Chinese | Everything, quest dialogue included |
| `ja_jp` Japanese | Everything, quest dialogue included |
| `ru_ru` Russian | Everything, quest dialogue included |
| `ko_kr` Korean | Everything, quest dialogue included |
| `es_es` Spanish | Everything, quest dialogue included |

Switch under **F6 → Data**, without changing the game's language or restarting:

- **Translation language**: which translations to show
- **Fallback language**: what to show where that language has nothing yet (another language, or the original)
- **Interface language**: the language of the F6 screens themselves (English included)

更新於 2026-09-29 / Updated 2026-09-29

**翻了哪些**：任務對話與任務書、物品（名稱、詞條、敘述、Major ID）、技能樹、介面（F6 設定、背包、交易市場、公會、地圖、追蹤欄）、NPC 與地區名稱、看板與聊天公告。

**大概翻到哪**：6 種語言目前都在 **95% 以上**，繁體中文最完整。剩下的多半是零星的名稱與半句話，而且遊戲還在更新——**一定還有漏的**。看到沒翻、翻錯或版面跑掉的，[開個 issue](https://github.com/LyuChaCha/WynnChaYuan/issues) 告訴我們就好。

**What's covered**: quest dialogue and the quest book, items (names, stats, lore, Major IDs), the ability tree, the interface (F6, inventory, trade market, guild, map, tracker), NPC and place names, signs and chat announcements.

**Roughly how far**: every language is past **95%**, Traditional Chinese being the most complete. What is left is mostly stray names and half-sentences, and the game keeps changing — **there will be gaps**. Found something untranslated, wrong, or laid out badly?

## Install

| Requirement | Version |
|---|---|
| Minecraft | 1.21.11 |
| Loader | Fabric |
| Dependencies | [Wynntils](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynntils) 4.2+, [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) |

1. Download the jar: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/LyuChaCha/WynnChaYuan/releases/latest) ·
   [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynnchayuan) ·
   [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/wynnchayuan)
2. Put it in `mods/` and press **F6** in game.

## A line switches back to English halfway?

**That is normal.** It means the sentence is not in the corpus yet, so the mod shows the original.

Export it and send it to us as described in [How to help](#how-to-help). Once it is added, everyone
gets it on their next launch; no mod update needed.

## How to help

Quest dialogue and NPC nameplates have no official data source; they only arrive when players run
into them. **You do not have to translate anything**, just hand us the gaps you found:

1. **F6 → Data → Export untranslated strings** opens `config/wynnchayuan/export`, which holds `captured.json`.
2. Look through the file and delete anything personal (other players' names, guild names, private chat).
3. **F6 → Data → How to submit** opens the [issue form](https://github.com/LyuChaCha/WynnChaYuan/issues/new?template=corpus.yml); drag the file in. Or send it to **LyuChaCha** on Discord.

The mod **never sends anything by itself**. The export already leaves out player names and guild,
party, shout and private chat, but the filter is heuristic, so check it before you send it.

For a wrong translation or term, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LyuChaCha/WynnChaYuan/issues);
include the English text if you can. Chat lines can be copied with Copy chat.

## Helping translate

No programming needed: translations are JSON, and you fill in `dst` on the GitHub website.

- [CONTRIBUTING.en.md](CONTRIBUTING.en.md): workflow, placeholders, colour tags
- [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md): term glossary (Traditional Chinese)
- [For translators](docs/for-translators.md): recent conventions and changes (Traditional Chinese)

To try your own translations in game: set F6 → Translation source to **Local**, then press Reload after editing.

## Building from source

```bash
gradle build
```

Requires JDK 21. Wynntils has no Maven coordinates: download the **Fabric** jar from
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynntils/versions) into `libs/` first (the build stops and tells
you if it is missing). Corpus checks: `python tools/validate.py`.

## Sponsoring

Free, and it will stay free. To buy us a tea: **<https://ko-fi.com/lyuchacha>**

**3 USD/month** or a one-off **10 USD** or more puts you on the sponsor list: below, under
F6 → About / Credits, and as an extra line above your nameplate. Sponsoring does not influence
translations, and there are no paid features.

## Translation team

The same list is in game under **F6 → About / Credits**. To add someone, edit
[`credits.json`](src/main/resources/assets/wynnchayuan/credits.json).
